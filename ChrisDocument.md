# R1FT-U6P

You may have seen the docs posted by isaac so ill also give my piece:

R1FT/Chris tried leaking all of our source from Zenith, including mine, isaacs, zips, and tims, then he decided to hack into isaacs account on Fortnite, reported it and fake confessed to cheating etc, fraud etc, then after that, he decided to keep going with the whole leak our shit thing, even tho we tried making peace and being the bigger team!
Anyway:

R1ft didnt stop, so we began taking action, we have reported him to Epic Games for the account robbery he does, R1Ft has multiple telegram accounts and is a fortnite account stealer, there is plenty of proof to back on this which has all been forwarded to Epic, thats where this ends other than the whole bombing his vps thing and the website, but thats not shit im involved with, even though i do have to say, i agree with isaac doing it, the cunt deserved it!


I open sourced skunky EGWS / Zenith so chris couldnt, same with isaac & the UML and zip with the Zenith backend, and whatever tim does next is up to him!
